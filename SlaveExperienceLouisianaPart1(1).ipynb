    "Last article, I gave my basic reasons for pursuing a research project into the changing demographics of the slave trade in the Americas. This was very broad, and very vague. However, now I am about to plunge into locating the necessary data to reconstruct the history I wish to reconstruct. And already I am running into technical issues. \n",

    "The archive I want to use was created 22 years ago, back when Microsoft was the preeminent provider of consumer computer products. Everything is saved as a .dbf database file, with .sav, .sps and other files used to port it to an SPSS application. I had never heard of SPSS before this project. It's a proprietary system currently owned by IBM and used heavily in the GIS community. Opening this type of layered database file in a modern environment is complicated. Microsoft has a deprecated product, Visual FoxPro, and of course there are paid products. However, I want to use a modern Jupyter notebook with Python, pandas and other standard data science tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "I turned to the great oracle, Google, to find out how to open a .dbf file in Jupyter. There is a fairly well known package, PySal, that seemed ideal. Unfortunately, I am using Python 3.8. Pysal is dependent on a package called Rasterio, which in turn is dependent on a set of C libraries called GDAL. And here is where I ran into issues. GDAL does not, for some reason, edit its path environment variables on a Windows machine with Python 3.8. There are open issues with several development teams, but all are quite recent (the past year or so) and the issue is not yet fixed. While I'd love to use a Linux machine, at the moment I'm stuck with Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I am going to have to sacrifice the convenience of Pysal and turn to a more hacked together solution. Python comes with a dbfread library. It is going to take some work to get dbfread into Pandas, but hopefully not too much."

It is understandable Python didn't really want to do this. By this logic, if the number 1,234.56 was passed to the parseN method, the result would be 1.234.56.

So I started thinking about when a number might *look* like a float but was, in fact, never meant to be such a thing. Suppose there was a field that said *0,*. This would obviously be corruption or entry error, but hey data is messy. If you called this parseN function on *0,*, it wouldn't convert to an integer, it *would* raise an exception, but would not trigger the replace method. Instead, it would turn into a float \"NaN\". I didn't want that data loss, even if I don't understand the data. So, I should really build a trap for such pieces of data.\n",

They will easily convert to integers, unless the program is trying to pass *','* or some other crazy character as a number. I don't know enought about the program to dig through why it is trying to pass those characters, so I weed them out with the length check.

However, in this case it looks like the originaly developer forgot to add a .strip() method they clearly meant to. This is because, in the comments, they clearly indicate they intend on testing for both empty spaces *and* spaces full of zeros for a datetime column. Nonetheless, they only strip off the zeros, not the spaces. I added a clause looking for the empty spaces and now it works."
